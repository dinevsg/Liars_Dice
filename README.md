<h1>Liars Dice</h1>
<p>
  Liar’s Dice is a social game of deception and strategy. Each player can only see the dice in their hand, but must make bids on ALL the dice, including ones hidden by their opponents. Players make bids and call bluffs on other players, while attempting to avoid losing challenges (and losing their dice!).
</p>
<h2>How to play</h2>
<h3>1. Play the first round by rolling all 5 dice and keeping them hidden</h3>
<p>
  To begin the first round, all players put all of their dice in their cup, shake it, and roll by flipping the cup over so their dice are hidden. They will peek underneath their cup to see what dice they have.
</p>
<h3>2. Place bet</h3>
<p>
  The first player begins the round by placing their bid. They will declare a quantity of dice (e.g. five) and the face value of the dice they’re bidding on (e.g. threes). With this bid, the player is saying that there are at least five dice between all players that are a three.
</p>
<h3>3. Play the next turn by increasing the bid or calling a "liar"</h3>
<p>
  Play continues and after each bid, the player is faced with 2 decisions:
  <ul>
    <li>Increase the bid</li>
      <p>Increasing bids on the next turn must be either: a higher face value and same quantity of dice (e.g. increasing from three fours to three fives or three sixes) OR a higher quantity of dice of any face value (e.g. increasing from three fours to four twos, etc).</p>
    <li>Call "Liar"</li>
      <p>When the turn rotates to a new player, if they believe that the bid exceeds the reality of what the dice reveal AND they feel so strongly that they’re willing to challenge, they can bluff by saying “liar”. Once "lair" is “called”, all players lift their cups to reveal their dice, and the quantity of the dice with bidded face value (plus the wild 1s) is counted. If the bidder doesn’t have enough of the dice called, they lose the round. If there are more dice of that face value than bid, the challenger who said "liar" loses the round. Whoever lost the round must remove one die from their cup, and they go first in the next round.</p>
  </ul>
</p>
<h3>4. Wild ones</h3>
  <p>You have the ability to activate wild ones mode</p>
  <p>1's are wild and can represent any face value in a call. The exception is if the call in the round has a 1 in it. </p>
